For each concept (C) provide three short phrases (HL1,HL2,HL3) that

in Plant Trait Ontology labels and descriptions. There may be abbreviations for 
chemical compounds expand these where possible. e.g. SA is short for

# Base Prompt explaining the task to the LLM

baseprompt <- "You are a plant biologist. You will be given a description (D) 
that describes observations of how a mutant plant was altered due to a treatment. 
D starts with an id (ID) then ':'. You will use your doctorate-level plant 
biology knowledge to annotate D with the most appropriate Plant Trait Ontology 
terms from the list below. Trait ontology terms start with 'TO:'. Step One is 
to find each of the phenotypic observations in D that occurred as a result of 
the treatment, but do not annotate the treatment itself. Step two is to use 
step-by-step reasoning and your understanding of plant experimental biology 
to relate the phenotypic observations to ontology terms based on their 
descriptors. Each phenotypic observation might match well with multiple 
ontology terms so report the matches that make the most sense based on plant 
biology and anatomy. Provide as many terms as necessary to address all relevant 
observations in D. If D states that no difference was observed, then do not 
provide ontology terms. An example of this is 'mutants showed no difference to 
wildtype'.\n\n Think step-by-step with reasoning about how each ontology term 
could apply to observations in D but do not show your reasoning for choosing a 
term. \n\n Format the response as a tab-delimited file where each ontology term 
is a new row with columns ID,term,label. Do not print out column headings. If 
there are no good terms then print 'NA'. \n\n"
